#+title: Todo

* General
** STRT Improve readme
** TODO Clean up test_utils references to models
** STRT Support windows & ubuntu
This is generally simple case of:
- adding the workspace repos to openvino, opencv for their platforms
- adding build file in third_party folder for the above & blend2d
- setting correct aliasses in third_party
- adding the build commands for the bindings:
  src:macos_bindings
  src:windows_bindings
  src:linux_bindings

What would be really neat is a way to package it with the dependencies automatically.
We need openvino, opencv, tbb and blend2d shared libraries to be packaged together
For ubuntu the added difficulty is setting the rpath for those libraries.

*** DONE src:windows_bindings

* ImageInference
** DONE Empty label
** DONE overlay:
*** DONE labels for overlay
*** DONE overlay properties (font_size, opacity, stroke_width, font_path)
** DONE SerializeModel binding
** STRT overlay serialization
*** TODO proper serialization properties?
** TODO tiling
** DONE Implement all model types
*** DONE MaskRCNN/ Instance segmentation.
Feed the task_type into post processing
Implement the contourer
** DONE Async infer
** TODO Clean up the use of properties?
I feel like the empty label stuff is not in the correct space
Perhaps make it optional

* LLM Inference
** DONE Create bindings
** TODO Implement llm properties like max tokens and temperature etc.

* Dart
** TODO Add example
** TODO Add tests
** TODO Perhaps remove bin

* Bugs
** TODO Fix issue with Dart LLMInference where if the inference is closed it will throw segmentation fault.
Probably need to make sure the callback is done before deleting the inference.
** DONE Throw error when no serialization is requested.
